For The database(SQL) the following tables were created

Country(FK to patient/Employee)
Occupation(FK to Patient)
Patient(FK to HealthStatus)
Hospital_Employee
Department(FK to Employee)
Medication(FK To MedicationOrder)
MedicationOrder
HealthStatus

_____________________________________________________________

Tables are filled with data to be tested when connected to C#

Database connected with C#

Implement logic on C# to be able to:
Add Occupation
Add Patient
Add Health Status
Add city
Add Country
Add Hospital Employee
Add Department
Add Medication
Add Medication Order


Two Major errors,DATETIME and incorrect numb of rows to values inserted.
-> Fixed

minor error, would not convert Date/Time from string
->Fixed

Minor error,"Add Medication Order" would not take "2" as "medicationId".
Error:Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'mdod_mdodid_pk'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.MedicationOrder'. The duplicate key value is (2).
The statement has been terminated.
->Unfixed



Seeing as the Menu had worked perfectly,the MenuCreate branch has been merged to master.

Implement:
Delete City
Delete Country
Delete Occupation
Delete Patient -> Gives error "The DELETE statement conflicted with the REFERENCE constraint" as it contains  data in other tables that references the data which is being deleted. However this is confusing as the same query executes on SQL with no problem. -> unfixed
Delete Department
Delete HealthStatus
Delete HospitalEmployee
Delete Medication
Delete MedicationOrder



Implementing the logic to show data for the tables.
Important to note that no UI was implemented for showing data,rather when the user clicks on "Show Occupation" for example,the programm closes and the data is displayed on the console app.

Implemented Show Occupations
Implemented show Patients

Ways the system Can be better:
Add auto increment for primary keys(PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1))
Change Sex data type to nvarchar
Inheritance may of have been used in general as "AddForm"
Able to add Exit instead of shutting the system down
Implement somre sort of simple UI for Showing the data
